# SprintEmailGenerator
Little tool to generate emails for the sprint report.

To generate an email for a sprint, just run the script via the command line with:

```
  ruby generate.rb {sprint number}
```

This also needs to be updated every year - simply change the "YEAR" constant in the Generator class to the current year.
